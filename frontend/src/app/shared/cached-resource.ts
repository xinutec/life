/** A root-scoped, cached read model over a server GET.
 *
 *  It exists to fix two things at once, the same way the app shell now does for
 *  identity:
 *   - **Retain across tabs.** A route switch destroys the component, not this
 *     singleton — so returning to a tab shows its last data immediately instead
 *     of blanking to a loading placeholder and re-fetching from scratch.
 *   - **Share one fetch.** Several views read the same catalog (Inventory, All
 *     items, Today, the to-do graph all read `items`); as a `providedIn: 'root'`
 *     singleton they share a single cache and a single request.
 *
 *  `refresh()` re-fetches in the BACKGROUND without clearing the visible value —
 *  the optimistic pattern: show what you have, update in place. So callers can
 *  call it freely on view entry and after a mutation without causing a flash.
 *
 *  Subclass it once per resource; the loader is the only per-resource part:
 *
 *  ```ts
 *  @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
 *  export class ItemsStore extends CachedResource<Item[]> {
 *    constructor() { const api = inject(LifeApi); super(() => api.items()); }
 *  }
 *  ```
